NOT: There are two contributors for the project: zx@wooduan.com and sure.zhang@gmail.com. Both are mine. I have switched my Windows account after failing to install AWS Beanstalk (it can't deal with Windows acount names with Chinese characters correctly). After swith, I happened to type in a differenct email address which caused the problem.
